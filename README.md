NASA Hazardous Asteroid Prediction

Overview

This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts whether an asteroid is hazardous based on various features provided by NASA datasets. The model is trained using historical data and aims to classify asteroids as either hazardous or non-hazardous.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from NASA and contains multiple features about asteroids, such as:

Absolute magnitude

Estimated diameter

Relative velocity

Miss distance

Orbit details
Model Details

The model is built using scikit-learn.

Various machine learning algorithms were tested, and the best-performing model was selected.

The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing features, and performing feature selection.

Results

The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate the model.

Confusion matrix and feature importance visualization are included.

Future Improvements

Enhance feature engineering for better prediction accuracy.

Experiment with deep learning models for improved classification.

Deploy the model using a web application (e.g., Flask/Dash).
